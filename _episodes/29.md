<p>Jerry is MIA so Ben and Patrice tackle the last topics of Deconstruct's 20s.</p>
<p>In our first article, the New York Times predicts the doom of Apple.  In the middle, CNET plays the component cost game with the Apple Watch... Ignoring guidance on the Apple earnings call.  In our headliner, UBS and BS Outsider write from an alternate universe where there the Apple Watch has little interest.</p>
