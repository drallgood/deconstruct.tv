<p>On today’s episode, Ben botches the disclaimer to a comical level.  Patrice joins him while Jerry takes care of his Pet so he’s not here.</p>  <p>In the first article, Rene Ritchie pens an excellent article that takes on a piece from Josh Toplosky about the iPad as a primary device.  We discuss why it can be a primary device for certain users and how iOS 11 tilts things in the iPad’s favor.  However, it's not all great for iMore since we take issue with iMore talking about iOS 12 rumors right after iOS 11 was announced.  iMore then defended their clickbait page.  Lastly, Macworld’s the Macalope takes on a Market Realist piece calling the Apple Watch a flop because its not the iPhone. </p>
