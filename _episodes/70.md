<p>Ben and Patrice are flying solo (or tandem) because Jerry got a new pet.  In our first article, Quartz blames bad managers everywhere on the ghost of Steve Jobs.  We get down not he complex person that was Steve and why the misbehavior of other execs have nothing to do with him.  In our second story, Apple Insider talks about all the time Apple was late to the party.  They just happen to include some of Appleâ€™s most successful products.</p>
