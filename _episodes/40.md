<p>On Episode 40, Jerry is still missing so Patrice and Ben Celebrate Episode 40 alone.  By celebrate we mean more crappy articles.  In our first article, we take on an article about the Apple Pencil from a source we never expected to talk about.  Next up, BGR tells us how new products get delayed, by a week, before they’re even announced.  Lastly, Tech Crunch predicts the doom of Android over Stagefright.</p>
