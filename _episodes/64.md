<p>On the latest episode of Deconstruct, Ben and Patrice hold down the ship. Oh yeah, Jerry is surprisingly here too.</p>
<p>In our first story (or is it an ad?) from ZDnet, they berate Apple for not buying Harman as Samsung did.  We go into the reasons it was a great decision for Samsung to grab Harman’s portfolio of audio brands, but may not have been a good fit for Apple.  In our second and last article, Barron’s Next has the “scoop” on Apple’s answer to Google Glass and how the non-existent product will effect its stock prices.  We argue you that you maybe shouldn’t mix your investing advice and rumors.</p>
