<p>On Deconstruct 67, Jerry ditched us for “work breakfast” so Ben and Patrice take on the worst stories in tech.  Ben predicted we would edit this July and his insights into our laziness were spot on.</p>
<p>In our first of four articles, Forbes talks about the Balmerization of Apple.  We are still waiting for the "Developers!  Developers!  Developers!” moment and their websites to stop autoplaying.  In our next article, Fstoppers looks for a mistress and writes a well thought out article on why they falling away from the Apple ecosystem.  In the final articles 9to5 and pretty much everyone else peddle the rumor that the iPhone 8 will switch to USB-C as fact.  Then KGI reports that they will stick with Lightning.  Yes, both rumors came out in the same week.</p>
