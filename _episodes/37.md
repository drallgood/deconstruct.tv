<p>In this episode, Jerry has fled the country to avoid his responsibilities.  So, Ben and Patrice take on the week's news.  
<br />
In our first article, CoM makes a BS list about how the Apple TV is somehow obsolete.    Next, USA Today's financial wing writes a horrible piece comparing Apple Watch numbers with Windows Phone.  Lastly, CNET lets the guy from Police Academy and Short Circuit write a tech article about Apple Music... and it shows.
