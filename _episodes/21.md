<p>In Episode 21, Patrice thinks he's Batmaaan and Ben and Jerry can't help but roll their eyes!</p>
<p>We take to task a couple comedians who made real life Gamer Gate problems and ask the question where comedy ends and real-life consequences start.</p>
<p>For our second story, 9to5 Mac asks once again what Steve Jobs would do. It makes us wonder whether there will be a Steve Jobs robot in the future and whether he'll be resurrected every time Apple does something.</p>
