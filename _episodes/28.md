<p>Ben and Patrice fly solo in Episode 28 since they have neither lives nor wives.  And in the wake of Apple Watch launch, stupidity happens big time!</p>
<p>In our first article, CNET makes assumptions about the Apple Watch's longevity.  In the second article, BGR shows its entitlement over having to wait for an Apple Watch they really don't even want to buy #whinybitchgate.</p>
