<p>For episode 65 we are at full strength for Deconstruct. </p>
<p>In our first story, CNBC makes its debut depicting Appleâ€™s doom with their high priced ANALysts.  We look at what happens in real world economics in a mature market.  In our second article, Forbes argues that the Apple Watch should support Android.  We roll our eyes at this complete misunderstanding of the platform.</p>
