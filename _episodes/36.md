<strong>We’re back!</strong><br />On episode 36: Patrice is missing so Ben and Jerry deconstruct this week’s crap.  In our first story, an NBA player blames his crappy season on the iPhone.  For our second article, Tech Crunch doesn’t understand what a review is.  Lastly, Fast Co, damns the Apple Watch based on inaccurate Slice data and adds a list article to boot.
