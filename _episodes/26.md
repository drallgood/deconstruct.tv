<p>The Audio is a little jacked and so are the stories.  For the opener Ben, Jerry, and Patrice tackle an article accusing HBO Now of being porn. <br/>Next, BGR uses the iSheep argument product waiting lines at Apple stores. <br/>Lastly, another misguided top-10 list that doesnâ€™t quite understand the new MacBook.</p>
