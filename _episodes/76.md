<p> On this episode of Deconstruct, Ben did the best disclaimer he’s ever done and forgot to record it!  It’s a very special episode since its Easter Fools Day.  Yes its both Easter and April Fool’s Day.  Ben and Patrice are here while Jerry, is somewhere else. </p>
<p>In our first story, BS Outsider derides the new iPad in favor of Chromebooks.  We breakdown the strengths of both devices.  In our second article, the Mac Observer pines for the return of the iPad Mini at a $199 price.  We answer why this is not likely to happen.  In our last article by the Verge, they detail a competitor to Apple’s AirPods, but have no idea how they sound.  We wonder if that is rather important for an audio device.</p>
