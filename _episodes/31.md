<p>Jerry got lost in the middle of nowhere so it's just Ben and Patrice.  In the first article, Engadget gets buyers remorse for the Apple Watchâ€¦ and whines about it.  Next, the Verge reports on cannabis coffee K-Cups.  Lastly, we take a look at a great article about Apple watch component costs from a writer who actually does his homework.</p>
