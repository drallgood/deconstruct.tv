<p>Jerry got lost in the middle of nowhere so it's just Ben and Patrice.  In the first article, Engadget gets buyers remorse for the Apple Watch… and whines about it.  Next, the Verge reports on cannabis coffee K-Cups.  Lastly, we take a look at a great article about Apple watch component costs from a writer who actually does his homework.</p>
