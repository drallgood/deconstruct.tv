<p>In episode 23, Ben and Jerry have serious audio issues and Patrice does an amazing job piecing it together.  </p>
<p>Our old Buddy Martellaro feels neglected by Apple and our eyes roll right our of our heads.  <br />
In other news, The Verge & Gizmodo bark up the tree of Bad-USB on USB-C and the New York Times releases a piece on Apple Watch causing cancer so bad they have to deconstruct it themselves.</p>
