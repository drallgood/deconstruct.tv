In Episode 35, Patrice, Ben, and this Jerry guy take on this week’s BS in tech news.  In our first story, 9to5 suggests Apple should become a bank without knowing all the regulations involved in banking.  In our other story, Macworld takes down the Wall Street Journal’s stupid idea that Apple should kill off the Mac.  The WSJ being behind a paywall is doing you a favor.
