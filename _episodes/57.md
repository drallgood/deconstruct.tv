<p>Somehow the entire gang of Patrice, Ben, and Jerry is here! And they complain about their day jobs getting in the way of the fun stuff...</p>
<p>In our first story, Sellers wants some great revolutionary technology for the Mac in a mature market. We think it should be all pink! Spence takes a patched exploit as Apple’s doom (yawn).  Lastly, BGR rails on a 2017 iPhone that doesn’t exist yet for copying Samsung. And we wonder what the iPhone 9 will be like... NOT!</p>
