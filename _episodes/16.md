<p>
In the latest episode, Patrice, Ben, And Jerry take on more badly conceived articles.  </p>
<p>After another Cunt of Mac article, they explain the pros and cons of styli on a modern touch screen and why Steve Jobs view on them was taken out of context. </p>
<p>
For the second story, Blackberry CEO John Chen writes a self-serving letter calling for App Neutrality and we tell you why this is a horrible, although somewhat transparent, idea.
