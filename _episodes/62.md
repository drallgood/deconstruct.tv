<p>Jerry is moving to a nicer street corner, so its just Ben and Patrice this week.</p>
<p>In our first article, a Mashable writer Josh Dickey tells us why he’s keeping his twice recalled Galaxy Note 7.  Even Mashable disagrees with this opinion.  In our second story, Forbes makes our heads explode and that’s just the website.  Contributor Ewan Spence tells us 21 ways the iPhone 7 sucks, without the 21 ways.</p>
