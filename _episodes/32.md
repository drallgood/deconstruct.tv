<p>In this episode Ben, Patrice, and some guy named Jerry take on this week’s worst articles: <br />
In our first article, BGR tries to link the “failure” of the mythical AppleTV TV with the mythical Apple Car.  In our second article, yet another BGR article disclaims the end to childish hating of Microsoft.  Heading up the rear, Carl Icahn writes another letter to Tim Cook. And we channel our inner Shatners to dissect it.</p>
