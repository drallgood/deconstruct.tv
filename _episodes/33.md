<p>In episode 33, Jerry joins Ben and Patrice take down more horrible writing.  In our first article we skip the Apple Watch to explain to the Guardian why proprietary software isn't malware.  In our second article, Gizmodo offers up a misleading article about the unsupported service port on the Apple Watch.  In our last piece, CoM dismisses Force Touch in the iPhone 6S before the phone ever exists.</p>
