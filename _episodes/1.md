podlove_summary: 'For years Patrice, Jerome, and Ben read crappy tech articles and kept the pain to themselves.  However it eventually became too much and Deconstruct was born.  This week the gang will introduce you to our new show and a couple examples of how NOT to write a tech piece.  Like all forthcoming episodes, this one isnâ€™t safe for the workplace, the kiddies, or writers from certain tech sites.'
