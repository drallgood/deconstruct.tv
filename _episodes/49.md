<p>In Episode 49, the spirits are high on Deconstruct as Ben, Patrice, and Jerry are full on liquid courage.</p>
<p>In our first story, Shitception is back and CoM wants to dip our Apple gear in Gold.  In our second article, our buddy Sellers writes more link bait… unless he doesn’t.  Lastly, the Guardian claims Apple is Doooooomed again because some developers don’t want to work there.</p>
