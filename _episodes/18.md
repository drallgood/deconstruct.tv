<p>Ben, Jerry, and Patrice are back for more.  </p>
<p>In our first article, Business Insider (or Bullshit Outsiders how we like to call them) tells you why a $2500 DSLR with a $2500 lens is better at taking long distance shots than  an iPhone 6 rear camera while the crew rolls their eyes. So hard it hurts!</p>
<p> In the next story, ZDnet writes a story claiming Victory for Android Lollipop for besting iOS 8’s crash rate…by 0.2%. While not even running on 2% of all active Android devices.</p>
<p>In the last story of the day, they answer Wired's question as to what an iPad is good for</p>
<p><strong>Things they mentioned:</strong><br />
<ul><li><a href="http://brendamour.net/en/2015/02/13/on-the-ipad-why-it-still-matters-a-lot-for-me/">Patrice's article about why he loves his iPad and why it still matters</a></li>
