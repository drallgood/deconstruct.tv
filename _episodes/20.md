<p>Ben, Jerry, and Patrice have made it 20 episodes without killing each other!</p>
<p>In this episode we talk about comments made by executives at Google and Apple and Motorola calling Apple's pricing model irresponsible.  Speaking of irresponsible, we break down a Peter Cohan (not Cohen) piece from Forbes and get the sense he has a vendetta against the Apple Watch.
