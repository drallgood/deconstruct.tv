<p>The whole panel is here this week and unlike last year, we’re not drunk.</p>
<p>In our article, our “friend“ Mr. Sellers wants to go back in time to where Apple made everything.  In this case, its 3D printing and we disagree that Apple would be served by entering an industrial business.  In our second article we applaud MacRumors for shooting down the idiotic rumors that Apple is getting into the vaping business. They do a great job is giving plausible options of what they patent could be.  Plus, we almost forgot the outro.</p>
