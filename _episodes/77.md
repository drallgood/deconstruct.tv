<p> On this episode of Deconstruct, Ben and Patrice talk about crappy articles while Jerry lives out the movie Vulcano in Hawaii.  First the crew gives a PSA on the passing of the Airport Router and why people should just move on to something great.</p>
<p>In our first article, INC talks up the long fabled macPad.  We use Windows 10 hybrids as an example of why this concept does not work.   In our second article, AppleInsider fights with Bloomberg over the HomePod.  We detail why AppleInsider might have a point based on incomplete information.  In our last article, TechPinions takes out all the BS regarding iPhone sales numbers.  We love when people do our jobs for us.</p>
