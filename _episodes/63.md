<p>Ben, Jerry, and Patrice had something special for World Kindness Day… no we didn’t celebrate.  Too much bullshit out there.</p>
<p>First Thomas Carter from the Huffington Post’s UK branch shuts down the people saying the new Touchbar MacBook Pros aren’t pro enough using actual real world examples.  In our last story, The Wolfmann from classic movies howls a shitty article for Yahoo Finance about the Ear Pods.  He claims Apple is dooooooomed because they were delayed and not end user repairable.  We counter with the realities of modern electronics construction.</p>
