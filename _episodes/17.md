<p>On the latest episode of Deconstruct, special guest Kelly Guimont joins Ben and Patrice while Jerry is medically excused.  </p>
<p>
Kelly talks with the team about her years at TUAW which recently was shut down by AOL.  They reminisce about the things they got to do and the people they got to meet because of TUAW.</p>
<p>
In the second story, Engadget and BGR report that Apple is boring in the wake of some new Microsoft announcements.  We give you you why its not. Oh yeah, they made $18 billion in profit.
