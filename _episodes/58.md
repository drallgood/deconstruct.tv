<p>Jerry is servicing a client for $100/ hr so its Just Patrice and Ben.</p>
<p>First up, Raymond Wong tries absolve Samsung of the Note 7 by shifting blame to the iPhone.  We sigh.  In our second article, Daniel Eran Dilger Saves us about 3 hours of show by calling out the bullshit after the iPhone 7 event.  If we ever see him, we owe him a drift.</p>
