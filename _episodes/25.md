<p>For some reason Ben and Patrice decided to record a show on Easter... And their brains were fried.  </p>
<p>BenGate returns, this time for the Galaxy S6.  Metallo shuns Apple for a streaming service that doesn't yet exist.  Lastly, Engadget has a problem with Apple releasing demo videos for the Apple Watch a week before you can pre-order it.</p>
