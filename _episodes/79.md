<p> On Episode 79 of Deconstruct Patrice and Ben take on a few crappy articles.</p>p>In our first article, iMore brings BenGate back from the dead for basically no reason at all.  Ironically, even they admit nobody cares.  In our second article, The Verge confuses Apple for Google and writes an article of Appleâ€™s ad sales business in place of failing iPhone sales.  Wait a second, when did iPhone sales start failing and when did Apple get an Ad business?</p>
