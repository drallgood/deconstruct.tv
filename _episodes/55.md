<p>Yes Patrice, this episode is number 55.  Ben ditched the show to go watch a shitty movie so its just Patrice and Jerry. </p>
<p>In our first article, Apple puts a gun to BGR’s head and makes them buy the iPhone 7 they don’t want.  But then again things might change.  In our second story, we hear about Samsung’s plans to march its troops on Cupertino after a bad quarter from Apple</p>
