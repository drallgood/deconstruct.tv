<p>We have a full panel in this episode of Deconstruct as we were able to locate Jerry and tape him to his mic.  Ben and Patrice also co-Host. </p>
<p>In our first story, we tackle a piece comparing unreleased products.  In our second, we tackle a pair of articles arguing that Apple should buy a major cable to satellite provider.  And yeahâ€¦ Patrice added ad music.</p>
