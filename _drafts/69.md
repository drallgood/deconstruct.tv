On Deconstruct 69:  Things are going wrong and it actually helps out Patrice and Ben.  Jerry was allegedly sick, but we’re not buying it. 

In our first article, Apple Insider pens an opinion piece talking about how and why Apple should be catering to hardcore gamers.  We break down how much of this article has nothing to do with PC/ Mac gaming.  In our second article, Siri is apparently dying and nobody got the memo.  We’re still confused by the article.
