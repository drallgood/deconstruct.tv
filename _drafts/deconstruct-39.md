On The 39th Edition of Deconstruct, Ben and Patrice take on the BS so you don’t have to.  In the first article, CoM confuses Apple TV gaming with the high end gaming consoles.  In our second article, we visit an alternate universe where Apple is dooomed, but they can save it.  In our headliner, IBT has the worst website Patrice has ever seen… and gives a top 5 list about why Android Wear is better than the Apple Watch.
