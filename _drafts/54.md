<p>On this very stylish episode of Deconstruct Ben, Jerry and Patrice channel their inner fashion geeks to discuss the latest tech news from a fashion magazine.</p>
<p>And as if that wasn't enough for one episode, there's Enderle getting everything wrong about Apple Stores and yet another instance of the "X things Apple should do" bullshit.</p>
