<p>Ben and Patrice are back.. to discuss Batman.  Normally we take on the worst of what’s out there, but what we found was pretty great, so we’re singing their praise.  In our first article, Ben Thompson from Stratechary (sp?) does their homework and shoots down all the nay-sayers with facts.  In our other topic, our frenemy Metallo writes an awesome article about about the Mac’s resurgence into the Enterprise market.</p>
