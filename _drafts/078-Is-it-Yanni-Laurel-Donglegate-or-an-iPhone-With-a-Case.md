<p> On this episode of Deconstruct, Jerry is trying to make a living in the ultra-expensive land of Hawaii.  That leaves Ben and Patrice to do the lamentable job of going over terrible articles in the week before WWDC.</p>
<p>In our first article, the Verge turns a mundane launch of an iPhone cable into a Donglegate rant.  In our second article, the Mac Observer sees a new iPhone model in an Apple PR photo.  We see a run of the mill iPhone with a case.</p>
