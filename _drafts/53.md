<p>On Deconstruct 53 Jerry is once again servicing a
  client for his business. So Ben and Patrice deconstruct something that is definitely not Shakespeare, even if it was very likely written by monkeys.</p>
<p>The first article doesn't even compute in Patrice's brain: it's all about the flash (no.. not the TV show) storage in 2018. For the second article, the two have to talk about an article from an outlet they never even expected to talk about. Oh and the last article? Well, the iPhone is DOOOOOOOOOOOOOMED, you know? </p>
