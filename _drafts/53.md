<p>The first article doesn't even compute in Patrice's brain: it's all about the flash (no.. not the TV show) storage in 2018. For the second article, the two have to talk about an article from an outlet they never even expected to talk about. Oh and the last article? Well, the iPhone is DOOOOOOOOOOOOOMED, you know? </p>
