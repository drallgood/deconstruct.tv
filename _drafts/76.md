<p> On this episode of Deconstruct, Jerry is absent without an excuse.  That leaves Ben and Patrice to pick up the slack.  </p>
<p>In our first article, we critique an article by Jason Snell for Macworld about a MacBook running iOS.  Wait a second, did we say that right?  In our second story, BS Outsider is who they thought they were writing a whinny opinion piece about the size of the iPhone X.</p>
