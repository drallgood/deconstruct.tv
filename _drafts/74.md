<p> On Episode 74, Jerry “misplaced” his local audio so we had to go to the backup audio. </p>
<p>On the bright side, we didn’t loose an episode…. Yes, that means Jerry is actually here joining Ben and Patrice.  In our first article, we get our German heritage on while we talk Octoberfest.  Unfortunately, its questioning why BGR wrote an article about beer and puke resistant shoes.  In our second article, Tech Crunch talks about their first world problems of wanting to upgrade to the iPhone 8 instead of the iPhone X.  In the article, Tech Crunch dismisses FaceID before even trying it and longs for old I/O nobody misses. </p>
