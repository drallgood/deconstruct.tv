<p>Patrice, Jerry, and Ben are back and ready for more punishment.</p>
<p>In our first article, BS Outsider uses surveys from an IT tool called Spiceworks to determine which tech companies are innovative.  It turns out to be more like an Enterprise popularity contest  In our last article, Tech Crunch pans Googleâ€™s data collection polices in its new Google Assistant.  The crew argues this is something that Google has already been doing for years and users have consented to.</p>
