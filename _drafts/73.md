<p>With Jerry “Working”, Ben and Patrice tackle all the crap that’s out there.</p>
<p> In our first article, Mashable calls Face ID a privacy disaster.  They make spent far too long talking about talking rumors and specular without bothering to find out any facts about the device.  Ben and Patrice point out that a camera has been on your device the whole time.  In our second article, the Verge claims there’s a conspiracy to keep your devices hard to repair to get you to buy a new phone.  We explain why the ecosystem is far more complicated. </p>
