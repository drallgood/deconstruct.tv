<p>Ben and Patrice were having a great day, and so was Jerry.  So good that he’s not here. </p>
<p>In our first article, Natural News tells us why Apple’s new wireless headphones will bombard you with radiation… like every other device with a radio.  In our last article Forbes is switching to Android because of the iPhone 7’s lack of headphone jack… even with the adapter in box.</p>
