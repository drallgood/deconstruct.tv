Fleeing from the tyranny of tech writers and **ANAL**ysts, the last three sane people in tech engage in a ragtag fugitive podcast in search… ah, fuck it, that’s Battlestar Galactica.  

For years Patrice, Jerry, and Ben read crappy tech articles and kept the pain to themselves. However, it eventually became too much and **Deconstruct** was born.  

Every week week the gang will introduce you to our new show and a couple examples of how NOT to write a tech piece and, who knows, maybe even a few good ones. Deconstruct is satire and isn’t safe for the workplace, the kiddies, or writers from certain tech sites.  Our format is to tackle 2-3 stories each week and deconstruct the article to show you exactly why we think its wrong.  Through it all, we want you to have a better class of tech sites.
